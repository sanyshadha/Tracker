### ISSUES

1) Get Orders must only fetch the INIT and ACCEPTED Orders, instead also fetches the Canceled and Refund Orders
2) The Accept Orders must only accept orders where the status is Confirmed instead does for everything
3) Same with Reject
4) Same with Update Shipping
5) Cancel must work only for orders which are confirmed 
6) Same with Return also the return amount must be auto fetched, as of now the amount is given by seller itself !!
7)
